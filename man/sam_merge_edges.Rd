\title{Merge Polygons Split at Tile Boundaries}
\usage{
sam_merge_edges(x, buffer = 2, by_prompt = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A geosam object or sf object with detection results.}

\item{buffer}{Distance in meters to buffer polygons before checking for
overlap. Larger values merge polygons that are further apart. Default is 2.}

\item{by_prompt}{If TRUE and a \code{prompt} column exists, only merge polygons
with the same prompt value. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
An sf object with merged polygons. Scores are aggregated by taking
the maximum score from merged polygons.
}
\description{
When detecting objects over large areas, geosam uses tiled processing which
can split objects that span tile boundaries into multiple polygons. This
function merges polygons that are close together, healing those splits.
}
\details{
This function is useful when you notice objects being split at regular
intervals (tile boundaries). The default buffer of 2 meters catches most
boundary splits without merging truly separate objects.

For aggressive merging of nearby objects (not just boundary splits), use
a larger buffer value, but be aware this may merge objects that should
remain separate.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Detect buildings over a large area (uses tiling internally)
buildings <- sam_detect(
  bbox = c(-118.5, 34.0, -118.4, 34.1),
  text = "building",
  zoom = 18
)

# Merge any buildings split at tile boundaries
merged <- sam_merge_edges(buildings)

# More aggressive merging (5m buffer)
merged <- sam_merge_edges(buildings, buffer = 5)
}
}
