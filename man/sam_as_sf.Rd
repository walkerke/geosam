\title{Extract sf Polygons from geosam or geosam_image Object}
\usage{
sam_as_sf(x, min_area = NULL, max_area = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A geosam or geosam_image object.}

\item{min_area}{Minimum object area. For geosam, in square meters.
For geosam_image, in square pixels. Objects smaller are filtered out.}

\item{max_area}{Maximum object area. For geosam, in square meters.
For geosam_image, in square pixels. Objects larger are filtered out.}
}
\value{
An sf data frame with polygon geometries, scores, and area.
Returns NULL if no polygons remain after filtering.
}
\description{
Converts detection masks to sf polygon geometries.
}
\details{
For \code{geosam} objects (georeferenced imagery), returns polygons in WGS84
coordinates with area in square meters.

For \code{geosam_image} objects (non-georeferenced images), returns polygons
in pixel coordinates where x = column (from left) and y = row (from top).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Georeferenced imagery
result <- sam_detect(image = "satellite.tif", text = "building")
buildings <- sam_as_sf(result, min_area = 100)

# Non-georeferenced image
result <- sam_image("photo.jpg", text = "dog")
dogs <- sam_as_sf(result)  # coordinates in pixels
}
