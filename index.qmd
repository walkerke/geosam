**geosam** brings Meta's Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) to R for detecting objects in satellite imagery and photos. Describe what you're looking for in plain text—no training data or model fine-tuning required.

The package provides a native R interface that integrates with terra for spatial workflows, sf for vector data, and mapgl for interactive visualization. Whether you're counting swimming pools from satellite imagery or extracting objects from photos, geosam handles the complexity of running SAM3 and returns familiar R objects.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("walkerke/geosam")
```

Then set up the Python environment:

```r
library(geosam)
geosam_install()
```

You'll need a [HuggingFace account](https://huggingface.co/) with access to the [SAM3 model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3).

## Getting started

```r
library(geosam)

# Detect swimming pools in Beverly Hills
pools <- sam_detect(

  bbox = c(-118.41, 34.09, -118.405, 34.095),
  text = "swimming pool",
  source = "mapbox",
  zoom = 18
)

# View interactively
sam_view(pools)

# Extract as sf polygons
pools_sf <- sam_as_sf(pools)
```
